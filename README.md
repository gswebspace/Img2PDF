# Img2PDF
Converts JPEG/PNG Images in a Directory to PDF files and Merges All the Images of each Directory as one PDF.

#The Benefit
I was required to scan a lot of Images of my Notes every semester and it took me Weeks to combine all the scanned images in order and prepare one PDF document per directory of images.

I later realized that a software can do this much faster , so I put in a few hours of work and amazingly this software reduced weeks of effort into 5 seconds.

#How to Download just the App ?
STEP 1 -Install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 (or higher)
<br>
STEP 2 -Grab the Zip file in the Application Directory
